* **Proposal 2B** by **Mask#9695**

**Section A:**
On enactment, all players are out on planet Earth. Players may not leave
the planet they're on without permission from the Galactic Overseer.
Players may ask for permission to leave by declaring their intention to
do so in a public channel.

**Section B:**
The Galactic Overseer is a coveted position held by a single player.
If a player who is not the previous Galactic Overseer announces who they
believe the Galactic Overseer is, and they are correct, the Galactic
Overseer must publicly confirm the accusation, and privately appoint a
new player to the position to replace them.  A player may only make this
accusation once a week.

**Section C:**
The Galactic Overseer may PM a player and instruct them to message
another player or a public channel.  A player messaged as such is
obligated to fulfill the instruction, within reasonable limit. The
Galactic Overseer may not instruct a player to make a change to the game
state.  A player's message made under the overseer's instruction is
treated as a manifestation of the overseer's instruction.

* **Proposal 9** by **rosewinsall#5416**

Each calender week one player can create a mini game of nomic. It will
last for seven days and start with only one rule. This one rule reads:
"Rules can be created, edited or removed with the agreement of three
players.". The winner of the mini nomic receives the title of "Mini
Nomic Monarch" and holds this title until they lose a mini Nomic.

The Mini Nomic Monarch title gives the player with this title double
votes on each proposal they vote on while they are the Mini Nomic
Monarch.
