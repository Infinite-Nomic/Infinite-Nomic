# THE METARULESET OF INFINITE NOMIC

## PREAMBLE

The game of Infinite Nomic has always been, and will always be, a center
for experimentation in the medium of Nomic and Nomic-like games. As a
community, we wish to foster creativity in the design of such games by
creating a space where unrestricted innovation is rewarded as well as
protected from itself. It is for this reason that we establish this,
the Metaruleset of Infinite Nomic.


## SECTION 1: ROUNDS

The game of Infinite Nomic is subdivided into rounds. Each round has its
own ruleset. The Metaruleset is active and must be followed at all
times, while the ruleset associated with each round must only be
followed during that round.

A new round begins when players generally agree on a valid initial
ruleset for the round. The process for selecting an initial ruleset is
not outlined here, but should be done in an orderly and democratic
fashion, giving due consideration to all proposed rulesets.

No metaproposal may refer to a player or group of players by any
non-changing uniquely identifiable or real-life characteristic such as
name or nickname, to give them exclusive advantages or disadvantages .
If a metaproposal does this, it will have no effect even if passed and
may be removed by a moderator as soon as possible.

A round ends when and only when the ruleset for that round specifies
that that round ends or when the players generally agree that it should
be ended.

Periods in which there are no rounds occuring are called interim periods
while periods while there are rounds occuring are called playtime
periods.


## SECTION 2: METAPROPOSALS

A metaproposal is a body of text specifying one or more changes to the
Metaruleset. Any player can submit a metaproposal by submiting its full
contents to the channel #metaproposals.

Whenever a metaproposal is submitted, players who have expressed
interest in recieving notifications should be warned about it as soon
as possible through Discord ping or a similar mechanism.

Unless otherwise specified by a different part of the Metaruleset, the
voting period lasts 72 hours after the metaproposal has been submitted.
During the metaproposal's voting period, players can vote either for or
against it by reacting with :+1: or :-1: respectively or they can remain
neutral by not reacting at all. If a player's vote is unclear, their
vote is considered to be against.

Once the voting term of a metaproposal had passed, if at least two
thirds of votes on that metaproposal are for it, it takes effect,
changing the Metaruleset as described.

Metaproposals are the only method by which the Metaruleset can be
modified.


## SECTION 3: EMERGENCY CASES

Infinite Nomic is a place to safely experiment with the game design of
Nomic and Nomic-like games. In the course of these tests, errors will be
found in the ruleset of the round and players will take advantage of
unintended consequences of gamestate changes. Such behavior is, in fact,
encouraged as it aligns with the goals set out in this Metaruleset.

In the case, however, that players decide that future play is impossible
or impractical due to unbalancing, a state of emergency can be declared.
In order for this to happen, two players who have the Moderator role
must agree that the situation is deserving of being a state of
emergency.

When the game is in a state of emergency, any player can submit a
special type of metaproposal called an emergency proposal. Emergency
proposals function in a similar manner to normal metaproposals, but have
the following differences:

- the voting period of emergency proposals lasts 24 hours, and
- emergency proposals can cause any arbitrary change to the gamestate.

Emergency proposals should function only to revert the game to a
playable state and fix any problems that players may have faced unmet
obligations during the state of emergency, if there are any.

The state of emergency ends when two players who have the Moderator role
agree that the issues that caused the game to enter a state of emergency
have been resolved.


## SECTION 4: DISCORD

The Discord Guild with the ID 515560801394753537 is the official forum of
Infinite Nomic, and can be referred to as "the Discord Server", "the Server",
or anything else that clearly identifies it. Unless explicitly specified by a
rule, game actions cannot be taken without the sending of at least one message
to the Discord Server. In particular, messages sent to fora other than the
Discord Server do not result in the performance of game actions unless
explicitly specified by a rule.

All references to "channels" (including references of the form "#name", even
when not explicitly described as a channel), refer to the channel with the
appropriate name in the Discord Server. In cases where there are multiple
channels with the same name in the Discord Server, and all but one are clearly
labeled as being archived, then any reference to that name refers to the sole
non-archived channel.
