# 1. On Rules and Rule Changes 

Each *rule* has an ID number, a title, and a body (a string of text).

# 2. On Proposals and Turn Order 
A proposal is a document designated as such by the rules. 
Each *proposal* has an ID number, a title, and a body (a string of text). 
If a rule ever lacks a title or has an empty title, a moderator may assign a title to it at any time.

When a proposal is adopted, it takes effect and any actions described in its body are carried out, except as explicitly prohibited by a rule. 
A proposal cannot take effect if it has not been adopted in accordance with the rules. 
Proposals can have neither retroactive nor future effect, even if their text explicitly states otherwise.

A player submits a proposal by posting a document labeled as such in #proposals. 
When submitting a proposal, a player shall label it with its ID number. 
Each proposal's ID number is determined at the time it is submitted, and is the number after the previously submitted proposal's ID number (or else 1, if there was no previous proposal).

# 3. Proposing and voting

The legislation process is broken up into two parts, proposal days and voting days. 
There are three proposing groups, group A, group B, and group C.
When a player joins the game, they are randomly assigned to a group already containing not more than 1/3 of the players.

On a proposing day, each member from the specified proposal group may submit one proposal. 
This proposal can be edited ONLY during that groups proposing day. 
Editing a proposal on its voting day or later renders the proposal illegal. 

The following day(s), all players may vote on the submitted proposals by reacting with a thumbs up (👍) or thumbs down (👎) emoji.  
Voting ends simultaneously with the start of the next proposing day, at which time all legal proposals that have a ratio of over 50% positive votes are adopted.
The weekly schedule is as follows:

Monday: Proposing day for Group A

Tuesday: Voting day for Group A proposals

Wednesday: Proposing day for Group B

Thursday: Voting day for Group B proposals

Friday: Proposing day for Group C 

Saturday and Sunday: Voting day for Group C proposals 

Players who have been assigned to a new group for any reason may only propose during that groups proposing day if they did not propose in their previous group's proposing day that week.

# 4.  Score

Each player has a score, measured in points. 
When a player enters gameplay, their score is 0 points. 

Each time a players proposal passes, they gain 5 points. 

The first player to reach 100 points wins the round, also causing the round to end. 

Players can only gain or lose points through methods specified in this rule. No other rules may define methods of gaining points.  

Players shall keep their score at the end of their nickname in parenthesis (for example, Klink (15)). 

If a player gains points and fails to update their name within 48 hours, the gained points are forfeit. 

If a player loses points, and fails to update their name within 48 hours, a moderator may update their point total on their behalf within 96 hours of the points being lost. 

# 5. Dad coin
Dad Coin is the the currency of this round. A Dad Coin is earned by creating a proposal that is passed.

# 6. \<untitled\>

If a proposal passes witg a grammatical error or misspelling which does not significantly impact its meaning or how it is understood, the error may be fixed (with the approval of the player who made the proposal) when entering it into GitHub.

If the person making the correction is not a mod on this discord server, they must have the correction verified by a mod on this server before entering it into GitHub.

# 7. Actions

Actions are events that can be triggered by players, through publicly specifying an Action's name and their intent to perform it. 

Each Action has 3 attributes: a name, a cooldown and a body of text which states what happens upon the triggering of said Action. 
An Action's cooldown is an integer that represents the multiplication of 24 hours a player has to wait until they can perform the same Action again. 
Any commands in an Action's body must be performed by the player who triggered the Action for its effects to occur. 

Actions can only be defined in this rule. Following is a list of Actions:
