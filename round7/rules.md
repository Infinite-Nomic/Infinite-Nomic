Infinite Nomic Round 7 Rules 

# Rule 1: Information 
The game is a board game, played on a virtual board. A representation of the board shall be kept in a google sheets file, linked to in #game-rules.

# Rule 2: Turn order
When someone becomes a player, their name is put at the bottom of the list of players in #game-rules. Players take turns according to this list, starting with the player on the top of the list and going down. When the player at the bottom of the list has taken their turn, players keep taking turns from the top again. The game begins immediately when the first player joins the game. 

# Rule 3: What happens on a turn
A player's turn consists of performing any actions the rules require them to perform on their turn, as well as optionally performing any other actions the rules allow them to perform on their turn. A player may choose to end their turn at any time during it, by stating their intent to do so in #public-forum). A player's turn autmatically ends ("passes") 24 hours after it started. When a player's turn ends, the turn of the player below them in the list in #game-rules begins simultaneously. 

# Rule 4: Proposing and voting
A player who does not already have a proposal being voted on may make a proposal by posting a message in #proposals. Players may then react to that message with either thumbsup or thumbsdown during the next 24 hours. When the voting period is over, if the message has more thumbsup reactions than thumbsdown reactions, the events stated in the proposal take effect. The rules are maintained on github, which is referred to by a link in #game-rules. If a proposal message is deleted or edited before it takes effect, then the proposal is retracted. It does not take effect and its voting period ends.

# Rule 5: The game board
The gameboard consists of the spaces defined in the rules. All players are always located on one of the board's spaces.

The gameboard has 10 primary spaces, inclusively numbered 1 through 10. Each primary space is adjacent to the primary spaces whose numbers are one greater than or lower than its own number, and the primary space with the highest number is adjacent to the primary space with the lowest number.

# Rule 6: Acting in the appropriate channel
For an action other than voting or making a proposal to be effective, it must be announced in #public-forum.

# Rule 7: Moving 
Up to once on their turn, a player located on a primary space may move "up" the board, that is, in the direction in which the numbers of the spaces increase (wrapping around if they reach the highest-numbered primary space). To move, a player announces they are moving and rolls 1d6 in #public-forum. They move exactly that many spaces up the board. A player's turn ends if within five minutes of moving they do not explicitly declare that they are continuing their turn.

# Rule 8: Points and the board tiles
All players have an integer associated with them called "points". 
Who has what amount of points is tracked in the list of player names in #game-rules. 
Upon becoming a player for the first time, a player has 0 points. 
When a player lands on a space divisible by 5, they gain 10 points. 

# Rule 9
Tile #4 of the board becomes an "Unlucky Space". 

A player who rolls a 4 on any dice counts as if they landed on an Unlucky Space, no matter the location of the player on the board.

If a player lands on an Unlucky Space, they either: 
a.  move back to tile #1 of the board. This does not count as if they have lapped around the board and gone past tile #10, and instead acts as a regression. 
OR:
b.  lose 5 points. If the player landed on tile #4, they stay on tile #4 with no further effects. If the player rolled number 4, they move to their destination ('p+4', where p is the players position before having rolled a 4) with no further effects.
A player can choose between option a or b when landing on an Unlucky Space.

b is not an option if points are not implemented, non-functioning or state otherwise.
