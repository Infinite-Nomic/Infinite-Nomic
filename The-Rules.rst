Rule 1: Resources
-----------------

There exist six types of resources in the game: Ore, Fuel, Carbon, Food, Science, and Trade Goods. By default, each player starts off with no resources. Rules may define ways to obtain, spend, and/or lose resources. A player may not spend more resources than they have, and unless another rule specifies otherwise, a player may not possess more than 2 of each resource at one time. 

Each player's resources shall be tracked in a GitHub document named "Cargo-Hold".

Whenever a player's proposal passes, that player receives one Trade Good.

Rule 2: Ships
-------------

Every active player has a ship. All ships have the following statistics (also referred to as the ship's "C-DSP"): 
Class (C) 
Durability (D) 
Speed (S) 
Power (P). 
Ships also have titles, but titles do not count as statistics. However, Ship titles are still noted next to a Ship's statistics, along with the name of that Ship's owner. A Ship's default title is the name of its class. 
A player may request to change a Ship's title by saying so explicitly in a channel and mentioning the Ship's new title (an @Archivist ping must also be included in the request). 
The request to change a Ship's title is not valid if the Ship is not your own or if another Ship already has said title. 

If a player has no ship and has never had a ship before, they are given a "Model-One" class ship that has 1D 1S and 1P as the default statistics.

If a rule states a players Ship is destroyed, the player is immediately issued a new "Junker" class Ship with default characteristics 0D 0S 0P. This rule designates all players whose Ship has ever been destroyed as losing the game.

All rules that define a new Ship class must also define that Ship class' default DSP. The status of each player's Ship shall be tracked in a Github document called 'Ships'.

Rule 3: Trading
-------------

Players can request to trade with other players by pinging them in #trading-centre (a trading specific text channel). A trade can only be an exchange of 1 Trade Good for 1 of any other resource, and both players must agree to the trade. Once a trade has been agreed to, a Moderator or Archivist must also be pinged to update the Cargo-Hold.
