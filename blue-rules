# Rule 1: Proposing
All members of this nation may propose changes—repeals, additions, or amendments—to this nation's rule-set. 
Proposed changes are passed if they receive majority approval.

# Rule 2: Referencing in proposals
No rule may reference a specific player or players as a separate entity from the whole nation, or have a similar effect, unless it benefits the greater good of the nation.

# Rule 3: Voting
Once a player has cast their vote on a proposal, they may not change it. 
Players may cast their vote by reacting to the proposal with either :green_heart: or :x:.

# Rule 4: Changing existing proposals
If a proposal is edited to change something other than a typo, players who have already voted may change their vote one time.

# Rule 5: Azulars as a currency
At the beginning of each day(00:00 UTC) all members of this nation gain 1 unit of a currency called Azulars.
