** Rule 1 **

There is a single person who is the Monarch. A proposal is a document submitted by a person other than the Monarch in a channel with the name #proposals. When the monarch publicly states that they approve a proposal, the changes to the gamestate specified in the proposal occur, except that the Monarch cannot approve a proposal that would specify conditions under which any person wins the game.

No person shall modify or delete proposals.

The Monarch is: @amonarchwhodidntleaveimmediately 

** Rule 2 **

If the Monarch fails to either approve or reject a proposal within 72 hours of it being submitted, then that Monarch is ceases to be Monarch and a different participant is  randomly chosen to be the Monarch.
