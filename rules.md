** Rule 1 **

There is a single person who is the Monarch. A proposal is a document submitted by a person other than the Monarch in a channel with the name #proposals. When the monarch publicly states that they approve a proposal, the changes to the gamestate specified in the proposal occur, except that the Monarch cannot approve a proposal that would specify conditions under which any person wins the game.

The Monarch is: @amonarchwhodidntleaveimmediately 

** Rule 2 **

If the Monarch fails to either approve or reject a proposal within 72 hours of it being submitted, then that Monarch is ceases to be Monarch and a different participant is  randomly chosen to be the Monarch.

** Rule 3 **

This rule associates with each player a scalar quantity known as Imperial Points. This is a representation of the number of points owned by them.
Imperial Points (IP for short) may also be referred to as points for short.

** Rule 4 **

Anytime the Monarch approves a proposal they gain 1 point.

** Rule 5 **

Each player must display how many points they have by displaying it numerically in their nickname.
E.g. Wolfgang (IP)

** Rule 6 **
When a player ceases to be a monarch, then they must choose one of the other players. The player that they choose gains 1 IP.

** Rule 7 **
No person shall delete proposals.

No person shall modify proposals without explicit public approval from the Monarch. Approval can only be given by the Monarch to correct the following superficial defects:
- Typos
- Improper formatting 
- Offending characters

** Rule 8 **
Each rule that does not have a number can be given a unique number by the Monarch. The first number given by the Monarch must be 1, each additional number given must be exactly 1 higher than the previous number.

** Rule 9 **
If the monarch approves a proposal, the proposer of that proposal gains 5 IP.

** Rule 10 **
The game of Imperial Infinte Nomic (4) is separated into distinct phases called 'days'. Each day begins and ends at the discretion of the monarch via announcement. 
The monarch may label days with a date (15.12.2019) but may only do so in ascending order from the last labeled day.
A day may last indefinitely if the monarch doest announce to end it (through Rule 2 and real world time have no effect on the Royal Day)

** Rule 11 **
A player gains 5 points when they provide proof of reaching a geohashing location from that day.
Geohashing locations are defined from the algorithm contained in the comic strip at xkcd.com/426. Recommended is visiting the url geohashing.info to find the daily geohashing location.

** Rule 12 **
Each player may own items. 
Items exist as representatives of objects or other entities that a player may possess. 
Items have various properties unique to each individual item or its copies.

** Rule 13 **
A player may have the role of Royal Crier (or Crier for short) and a new channel #dailycry.
The purpose of the Royal Crier is to track players and their assets (IP, items, any further information) through public announcements.
Royal Crier is chosen by the monarch. 

Current RC is @Wolfgang Forrest#6337.

** Rule 14 **
When a Rule calls for an office whose holder is defined in the Rules, the Monarch can, by public announcement, amend the Rule that defines the holder of the office in order to update the holder, provided the new holder is selected using the method specified in the rules.
