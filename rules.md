# Rule 1: Becoming a member 
Each player begins the game as a member of the world and as a member of one nation. Players must obey the global rule-set as well as their nation's rule-set.

# Rule 2: Joining the game 
If a player is not a member of the Red, Blue or Yellow nation, they may join a nation by having an administrator of this game witness them stating their intent to do so. The administrator shall then randomly assign that player to a nation that does not already contain more than 1/3 of the world's members.

# Rule 3: Three nations 
There are three nations: Red, Yellow, and Blue.

# Rule 4: Winning the game 
When a nation amasses 100 points or more, the nation with the most points wins the game collectively.

# Rule 5: Meta - points and winning, conflicting rules 
Only rules in the global rule-set (this rule-set), may define win conditions or deal with points. If a rule in the global rule-set conflicts with a rule in a local rule-set, the global rule takes priority.

# Rule 6: Proposing 
All players may propose changes to the global rule-set: new rules, or repeals or amendments of existing rules. Proposed changes are passed if more than two thirds of players indicate their approval, and take effect immediately.

# Rule 7: Gaining points 
Each time a global rule-change is passed, an administrator shall roll one six-sided die for each nation and each nation gains the respective amount of points.

# Rule 8: Voting
Once a player has cast their vote on a proposal, they may not change it. Players may cast their vote by reacting to the proposal with either :white_check_mark: or :negative_squared_cross_mark:.

# Rule 9: Inactivity 
A player is considered inactive if they have not sent a message in any text channel within the last 7 days. Inactivate players are considered active again once they send a message into a text channel.

# Rule 10: Leaving the game 
A player may leave the game (stop being a player and stop being a member of any nation) by indicating their desire to do so. This rule is retroactive.

# Rule 11: Retroactivity 
No proposals, global or otherwise, including this one, may have retroactive effect.

# Rule 12: Validating & invalidating proposals
1. Global proposals are marked with a no_entry_sign if a rule determines that they have failed or been invalidated
2. A global proposal being edited will automatically invalidate it
3. Failed or invalidated proposals cannot pass under any circumstances
4.  Global proposals may be invalidated by the player that proposed them at any time as long as the proposal has not already passed
5. A global proposal that is not invalidated and does not meet the normal criteria for passing can pass if it meets the following special criteria:
*72 hours have passed since the proposal was made
*At least one third of the games active players have voted on the proposal
*At least two thirds of the votes have been positive

# Rule 13: Retracting proposals
You may retract a proposal. Before the proposal has solidified, you can remove it. You may do so however you like, as long as you clarify that you retract it and that it is no longer up for voting.
