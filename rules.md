# Rule 1
There is a single person who is the Monarch. A proposal is a document submitted by a person other than the Monarch in a channel with the name #proposals. When the monarch publicly states that they approve a proposal, the changes to the gamestate specified in the proposal occur, except that the Monarch cannot approve a proposal that would specify conditions under which any person wins the game.

The Monarch is: @Random Internet Cat#6930

# Rule 2
If the Monarch fails to either approve or reject a proposal within 72 hours of it being submitted, then that Monarch is ceases to be Monarch and a different participant is  randomly chosen to be the Monarch.

# Rule 3
This rule associates with each player a scalar quantity known as Imperial Points. This is a representation of the number of points owned by them. Imperial Points (IP for short) may also be referred to as points for short.
This value may never fall below 0. If any event would render a player's IP <0, their IP value will simply stop at 0.

# Rule 4
Anytime the Monarch approves a proposal, they gain 1 IP, and the proposer of that proposal gains 5 IP.

# Rule 5
A player's IP value is listed in the channel #dailycry. The Royal Crier keeps record of points as faithfully as possible. Any discrepancies in IP value can be challenged by any player. The result of this challenge is adjudicated by Lord Justice. 

# Rule 6
When a player ceases to be a monarch, then they must choose one of the other players. The player that they choose gains 1 IP.

# Rule 7
No person shall delete proposals. No person shall edit a proposal after the Monarch has publicly approved or refused to approve it.

# Rule 8
Each rule that does not have a number can be given a unique number by the Monarch. The first number given by the Monarch must be 1, each additional number given must be exactly 1 higher than the previous number.

# Rule 10
The game of Imperial Infinite Nomic (4) is separated into distinct phases called 'days' to represent turns and effects of time in game. Each day begins and ends at the discretion of the monarch via announcement. A day may last indefinitely if the monarch doesn't announce to end it (through Rule 2 and real world time have no effect on the Royal Day) The monarch may only progress to the next day every 24 hours in the real world.

# Rule 11
A player gains 5 points when they provide proof of reaching a geohashing location from that day.
Geohashing locations are defined from the algorithm contained in the comic strip at xkcd.com/426. Recommended is visiting the url geohashing.info to find the daily geohashing location.

# Rule 12
Each player may own items. Items exist as representatives of objects or other entities that a player may possess. Items have various properties unique to each item and its copies.
Players may obtain items through means specified in the items description.
Two common methods are 
bequeathment (the monarch gives the item to a player) and 
purchase, where a player with sufficient IP or other resources can lose a specific number of IP or resources to gain the item being purchased.

Items that are available in game are listed in the channel #dailycry along with other relevant information.

# Rule 13
A player may have the role of Royal Crier (or Crier for short) and a new channel #dailycry.
The purpose of the Royal Crier is to track players and their assets (IP, items, any further information) through public announcements.
Royal Crier is chosen by the monarch. 

Current RC is @Wolfgang Forrest#6337.

# Rule 14
When a Rule calls for an office whose holder is defined in the Rules, the Monarch can, by public announcement, amend the Rule that defines the holder of the office in order to update the holder, provided the new holder is selected using the method specified in the rules.

# Rule 15
At the beginning of each new Royal Day, the Monarch collects taxes of 10% of each player's total IP, rounded down to the nearest whole point. The Royal Crier shall record the updated balances in the #dailycry.

# Rule 16
The Monarch may appoint, by public announcement, a person to act as Lord Justice. The Lord Justice shall write Adjudications to resolve disputes or ambiguities in rule interpretation. Adjudications shall be numbered sequentially starting at 1. If the Lord Justice fails to post an Adjudication within 72 hours of a request to do so from any player, they cease to be Lord Justice with immediate effect and the Monarch shall appoint their replacement.

# Rule 17
Item; Village Villages produce one IP per imperial day which is added to its owner's IP value. Players may purchase a Village for 10+n IP (n=number of villages in play at the start of that day).

# Rule 18
The Monarch may bequeath the Imperial Seal to any other person in order to ease the burdens of their office. There is only one Imperial Seal. The person in possession if the Seal may accept or reject proposals and otherwise discharge the duties of the Monarch on their behalf. Rules enacted, amended or repealed under the authority of the Seal shall be marked with an “IS” for easy identification. The Monarch may overturn a decision made under the authorty of the Seal at any time, by public announcement, but this shall not retrospectively invalidate any activities which took place while the decision was under effect.

# Rule 19
Players may trade items and IP with each other by any agreement, as long as the terms of such an agreement are posted publicly and attested by all involved parties. Unless allowed explicitly by another rule, loan agreements of IP are not allowed, nor any agreement involving interest.

# Rule 20
When a player who is monarch ceases to be monarch, their IP value is shared equally (rounded down) amongst all players, including the former monarch.

# Rule 21
The Monarch may subtract any amount of IP from one player per Royal Day. 
Upon doing this, the Monarch also loses the same amount of IP. 

# Rule 22
At the start of every new day, the monarch may choose 1 player other than themselves, this player receives 1 Village. The monarch receives IP equal to the number of Villages that player now has. The monarch may not choose the same player twice in a row.
If the monarch fails to do so by the end of the day, a player is randomly chosen to recieve a village (but the monarch gets no points from this).

# Rule 23
The Monarch may declare a Tournament Day with one royal day’s notice by public announcement. Such notice may include a theme for the Tournament. On a Tournament Day, players may elect to present themselves to the court by posting one piece of content in #creativity. The Monarch may gift to participating players up to an overall total of 50 IP per Tournament, by public announcement. (Prizes are added to the winner’s total after the next round of tax, but not deducted from the Monarch’s total.)

# Rule 24
Item; Haggler; For each Haggler that a player owns, they may temporarily reduce the price of items on the market by 5IP once per day. The price reduction stays until any player purchases an item with reductions, the reductions are removed and the price returns to normal the following day. This reduction cannot be applied to Hagglers. Prices cannot be reduced below 5IP.
Costs 15IP

# Rule 25
Associate with each player a scalar quantity known as Council Points.  Council Points (CP for short) may also be referred to as points for short. 1CP may be converted into (or sold for) 25IP.

# Rule 26
Royal Council is an event that occurs at the beginning of the last day of the week (Day 7, 14, 21, etc).

The monarch chooses two suggested motions and presents them to the players. All players but the monarch then vote. They can choose either one motion or neither.

The option (either one motion or neither) which has the most votes is adopted (if it is a motion). That motion (if any) takes effect immediately, and any effects that are not immediately resolved may still be in effect until the beginning of the next council (last day of the week). These effects take precedence over all other rules except for this one. All players but the monarch may suggest one motion for the upcoming Royal Council. Motions may not enact rules.

The votes for the motions(or neither) are couted at the end of the Royal Council.

Players may expend CP to gain votes (1CP = 1 vote).

# Rule 27
Players receive 1CP for;
Royal Council occurring
Proposing a motion 
Having their motion chosen for voting 
Having their motion receive the most votes

# Rule 28
Players may combine three or more villages they own into a town, by making a public announcement and assigning the town a name not used elsewhere in the game.

Each town is associated with an integer called its size, which represents the number of constituent villages it contains, and is initially set to the number of villages combined to form it. Each royal day, a town yields its size in IP and this is added to its owner’s IP value.

Towns grow in size organically on the last day of each royal week, irrespective of when the town was formed or last grown. Organic growth is accounted before the day’s land yield. The addition to the size is S/10 rounded up to the nearest whole number, where S is the size before the growth. A town may also be artificially grown at any time if a player declares they combine it with one or more villages they own. 

Towns cannot be combined, nor can they be split into villages or smaller towns.

The size value of a town counts towards the total number of villages with regards to calculating the cost of purchasing a village.

# Rule 29
A city is a town which is granted city status by the Monarch. Unless expressly contradicted, all rules applying to towns also apply to cities; but rules applying to cities do not also apply to towns unless this is expressly stated.

By public announcement, the Monarch may grant any town city status at any time and for any reason, and may revoke or reinstate such a grant at any time and for any reason. Players may petition for a royal warrant for city status for a town with a size of ten or more.

A city produces a daily IP yield of of its size plus 10%, rounded down to the nearest whole point.

# Rule 30
The principle administrative divisions of Imperial Nomic are the barony, the county, and the duchy.

# Rule 31
Players other than the Monarch may declare a group of three or more habitations they possess to be a barony. (A habitation is a village or town.) On creation, the barony must be given a name not otherwise used in the game. Players possessing a barony earn the right to the title of baron or baroness.

# Rule 32
The Monarch may declare a group of three or more counties to be a duchy. Players who are not the Monarch may petition for such a declaration. On creation, the player who owns the duchy must give it a name not otherwise used in the game, and circulate a sketched map of the territory involved. Players posessing a duchy earn the right to the title of duke or duchess.

# Rule 33
Once per day, the player with the most Villages must pay a property tax equal to  n/2 IP, rounded down to the nearest whole number (n = number of villages owned by that player). This tax is stored in The Treasury, which is listed in #dailycry. In the event of a tie for the most villages, no tax is paid. 

# Rule 34
For 1000 IP a player purchase a Mine by publically stating their purchase in #nomic. Any player with a Mine gains 20 IP per day.

# Rule 35
A player can ask for a loan from the Treasury. The monarch is entitled to negotiate the payment of the loan, including , method of payment(ips or in game items),time of payment, and value paid(never smaller than the value of the loan).
The monarch is also entitled to withhold the loan.

# Rule 36
The Treasury is exempt from the tax of Rule 15. Instead the monarch after collecting taxes pays 10% of their IP value rounded down to the Treasury. 

# Rule 37
Unless otherwise specified, actions or consequences called for in lower rule numbers take place before and with precedence over actions called for in higher rule numbers. Sequences of actions within single rules take place in the order presented. Compulsory actions, if required to take place at a specific time, are considered to have taken place at that time even if the administration of those actions is delayed.
