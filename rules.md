** Rule 1 **

There is a single person who is the Monarch. A proposal is a document submitted by a person other than the Monarch in a channel with the name #proposals. When the monarch publicly states that they approve a proposal, the changes to the gamestate specified in the proposal occur, except that the Monarch cannot approve a proposal that would specify conditions under which any person wins the game.

The Monarch is: @amonarchwhodidntleaveimmediately 

** Rule 2 **

If the Monarch fails to either approve or reject a proposal within 72 hours of it being submitted, then that Monarch is ceases to be Monarch and a different participant is  randomly chosen to be the Monarch.

** Rule 3 **

This rule associates with each player a scalar quantity known as Imperial Points. This is a representation of the number of points owned by them.
Imperial Points (IP for short) may also be referred to as points for short.

** Rule 4 **

Anytime the Monarch approves a proposal they gain 1 point.

** Rule 5 **

Each player must display how many points they have by displaying it numerically in their nickname.
E.g. Wolfgang (IP)

** Rule 6 **
When a player ceases to be a monarch, then they must choose one of the other players. The player that they choose gains 1 IP.

** Rule 7 **
No person shall delete proposals.

No person shall modify proposals without explicit public approval from the Monarch. Approval can only be given by the Monarch to correct the following superficial defects:
- Typos
- Improper formatting 
- Offending characters

** Rule 8 **
Each rule that does not have a number can be given a unique number by the Monarch. The first number given by the Monarch must be 1, each additional number given must be exactly 1 higher than the previous number.

** Rule 9 **
If the monarch approves a proposal, the proposer of that proposal gains 5 IP.
