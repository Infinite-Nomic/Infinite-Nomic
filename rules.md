# Rule 1
Each player begins the game as a member of the world and as a member of one nation. Players must obey the global rule-set as well as their nation's rule-set.

# Rule 2
If a player is not a member of the Red, Blue or Yellow nation, they may join a nation by having an administrator of this game witness them stating their intent to do so. The administrator shall then randomly assign that player to a nation that does not already contain more than 1/3 of the world's members.

# Rule 3
There are three nations: Red, Yellow, and Blue.

# Rule 4
When a nation amasses 100 points or more, the nation with the most points wins the game collectively.

# Rule 5
Only rules in the global rule-set (this rule-set), may define win conditions or deal with points. If a rule in the global rule-set conflicts with a rule in a local rule-set, the global rule takes priority.

# Rule 6
All players may propose changes to the global rule-set: new rules, or repeals or amendments of existing rules. Proposed changes are passed if more than two thirds of players indicate their approval, and take effect immediately.

# Rule 7
Each time a global rule-change is passed, an administrator shall roll one six-sided die for each nation and each nation gains the respective amount of points.

# Rule 8
Once a player has cast their vote on a proposal, they may not change it. Players may cast their vote by reacting to the proposal with either :white_check_mark: or :negative_squared_cross_mark:.

# Rule 9
A player is considered inactive if they have not sent a message in any text channel within the last 7 days. Inactivate players are considered active again once they send a message into a text channel.
