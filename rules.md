* **Rule 1** *(Strength=10)*

These are the rules of Infinite Nomic; all players must abide by them.
The ruleset is stored on a page at:
https://github.com/klinkplink/Infinite-Nomic.

* **Rule 2** *(Strength=1)*

Discord users may become players (join the game) or cease to be players
(leave the game) by posting an announcement of this intent in
**#join-game**.

* **Rule 3** *(Strength=1)*

No more than two times per calendar week (UTC), a player can submit a
rule change proposal, which specifies an addition, deletion, or
modification of a single rule. Each proposal must include an ID (IDs
start at 1, increasing with 1 for every new proposal).

Submitting a rule change proposal that modifies or deletes Rule 1 is a
10-Strengthened action.

If a player has 1 or more Prestige Points,  they can instead make rule
change proposals no more than three times per calendar week.

* **Rule 4** *(Strength=1)*

There is a job called the Announcer. The Announcer reports to
**#announcements** all pending proposals and all proposals passed since
the last announcement. This must be done exactly three days each week,
which days are determined by each Announcer upon taking the job. The
first Announcer is **@rosewinsall#5416**.

* **Rule 5** *(Strength=1)*

At the time of each announcement, the Announcer shall post all proposals
submitted since the last announcement in **#voting**. Each :thumbsup:
reaction on a proposal counts as a yay vote and each :thumbsdown:
reaction on a proposal counts as a nay vote. If there are more yay votes
than nay votes when the next announcement is posted, the proposal comes
into effect.

If there are not more yay votes than nay votes when the next
announcement is posted, the proposal is instead stored in a GitHub
document called **proposal-graveyard**. This rule is retroactive.

* **Rule 6** *(Strength=1)*

All rules have a trait called Strength.  All rules that are created
without a Strength or do not have a Strength at any time are given a
Strength of 1. In the case of a rule conflict, the rule with the
higher Strength takes precedence.

* **Rule 7** *(Strength=1)*

There is a job called the Scribe of Rules who shall, once every time a
rule change proposal is passed, apply the changes it specifies to the
ruleset. The first Scribe of Rules is **@CodeTriangle#0726**.

* **Rule 8** *(Strength=1)*

If a jobholder has consistently failed to perform their job, any player,
with the assent of two other players, can oust them from the position.
Jobholders may also resign. If a job is vacant, any player, with the
assent of two other players, can become its new jobholder.

* **Rule 9** *(Strength=1)*

A player has 1 Prestige Point per job they are currently holding. If a
player has at least 5 Prestige Points, their yay/nay votes count as two
effective votes in #voting.

* **Rule 10** *(Strength=1)*

A calendar week starts on a Monday at 12am UTC.

* **Rule 11** *(Strength=1)*

When an action is defined as "N-strengthened" only rules with power
equal to or above N can perform that action. If N is not specified, it
is taken to mean the strength of that rule.

* **Rule 12** *(Strength=1)*

There is a job called the Enforcer. If another jobholder has not taken
the actions designated by their job within 24 hours, the Enforcer pings
them with a reminder in **#nomic**. There can be a total of three
Enforcers. The first Enforcer is **@Klink#0666**.
