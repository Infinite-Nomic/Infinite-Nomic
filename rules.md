# Rule 1
There is a single person who is the Monarch. A proposal is a document submitted by a person other than the Monarch in a channel with the name #proposals. When the monarch publicly states that they approve a proposal, the changes to the gamestate specified in the proposal occur, except that the Monarch cannot approve a proposal that would specify conditions under which any person wins the game.

The Monarch is: @Random Internet Cat#6930

# Rule 2
If the Monarch fails to either approve or reject a proposal within 72 hours of it being submitted, then that Monarch is ceases to be Monarch and a different participant is  randomly chosen to be the Monarch.

# Rule 3
This rule associates with each player a scalar quantity known as Imperial Points. This is a representation of the number of points owned by them. Imperial Points (IP for short) may also be referred to as points for short.
This value may never fall below 0. If any event would render a player's IP <0, their IP value will simply stop at 0.

# Rule 4
Anytime the Monarch approves a proposal they gain 1 point.

# Rule 5
Each player must display how many points they have by displaying it numerically in their nickname.
E.g. Wolfgang (IP)

# Rule 6
When a player ceases to be a monarch, then they must choose one of the other players. The player that they choose gains 1 IP.

# Rule 7
No person shall delete proposals. No person shall edit a proposal after the Monarch has publicly approved or refused to approve it.

# Rule 8
Each rule that does not have a number can be given a unique number by the Monarch. The first number given by the Monarch must be 1, each additional number given must be exactly 1 higher than the previous number.

# Rule 9
If the monarch approves a proposal, the proposer of that proposal gains 5 IP.

# Rule 10
The game of Imperial Infinte Nomic (4) is separated into distinct phases called 'days' to represent turns and effects of time in game. Each day begins and ends at the discretion of the monarch via announcement. A day may last indefinitely if the monarch doesn't announce to end it (through Rule 2 and real world time have no effect on the Royal Day)
The monarch may only progress to the next day every 24 hours in the real world.

# Rule 11
A player gains 5 points when they provide proof of reaching a geohashing location from that day.
Geohashing locations are defined from the algorithm contained in the comic strip at xkcd.com/426. Recommended is visiting the url geohashing.info to find the daily geohashing location.

# Rule 12
Each player may own items. Items exist as representatives of objects or other entities that a player may possess. Items have various properties unique to each item and its copies.
Players may obtain items through means specified in the items description.
Two common methods are 
bequeathment (the monarch gives the item to a player) and 
purchase, where a player with sufficient IP or other resources can lose a specific number of IP or resources to gain the item being purchased.

Items that are available in game are listed in the channel #dailycry along with other relevant information.

# Rule 13
A player may have the role of Royal Crier (or Crier for short) and a new channel #dailycry.
The purpose of the Royal Crier is to track players and their assets (IP, items, any further information) through public announcements.
Royal Crier is chosen by the monarch. 

Current RC is @Wolfgang Forrest#6337.

# Rule 14
When a Rule calls for an office whose holder is defined in the Rules, the Monarch can, by public announcement, amend the Rule that defines the holder of the office in order to update the holder, provided the new holder is selected using the method specified in the rules.

# Rule 15
At the beginning of each new Royal Day, the Monarch collects taxes of 10% of each player's total IP, rounded down to the nearest whole point. The Royal Crier shall record the updated balances in the #dailycry.

# Rule 16
The Monarch may appoint, by public announcement, a person to act as Lord Justice. The Lord Justice shall write Adjudications to resolve disputes or ambiguities in rule interpretation. Adjudications shall be numbered sequentially starting at 1. If the Lord Justice fails to post an Adjudication within 72 hours of a request to do so from any player, they cease to be Lord Justice with immediate effect and the Monarch shall appoint their replacement.

# Rule 17
Item; Village 
Villages produce one IP per imperial day which is added to its owner's IP value. 
The cost of a village is 10+5n IP (n=number of villages in play at the start of that day).
Players with sufficient IP may state that they wish to purchase a village in #nomic, and after subtracting the required IP, obtain the village. 

# Rule 18
The Monarch may bequeath the Imperial Seal to any other person in order to ease the burdens of their office. There is only one Imperial Seal. The person in possession if the Seal may accept or reject proposals and otherwise discharge the duties of the Monarch on their behalf. Rules enacted, amended or repealed under the authority of the Seal shall be marked with an “IS” for easy identification. The Monarch may overturn a decision made under the authorty of the Seal at any time, by public announcement, but this shall not retrospectively invalidate any activities which took place while the decision was under effect.

# Rule 19
Players may trade items and IP with each other by any agreement, as long as the terms of such an agreement are posted publicly and attested by all involved parties.

# Rule 20
When a player who is monarch ceases to be monarch, their IP value is shared equally (rounded down) amongst all players, including the former monarch.

# Rule 21

Upon doing this, the Monarch also loses the same amount of IP. 

# Rule 22

(Prizes are added to the winner’s total after the next round of tax, but not deducted from the Monarch’s total.)

# Rule 24
