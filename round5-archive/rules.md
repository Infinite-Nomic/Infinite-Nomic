# Rule 1: Becoming a member 
Each player begins the game as a member of the world and as a member of one nation. Players must obey the global rule-set as well as their nation's rule-set.

# Rule 2: Joining the game 
If a player is not a member of the Red, Blue or Yellow nation, they may join a nation by having an administrator of this game witness them stating their intent to do so. The administrator shall then randomly assign that player to a nation that does not already contain more than 1/3 of the world's members.

# Rule 3: Three nations 
There are three nations: Red, Yellow, and Blue.

# Rule 4: Winning the game 
"When a nation a masses 1000 Victory Points or more, the nation with the most points wins the game collectively."

# Rule 5: Meta - points and winning, conflicting rules 
Only rules in the global rule-set (this rule-set), may define win conditions or deal with Global Credits or Victory Points. If a rule in the global rule-set conflicts with a rule in a local rule-set, the global rule takes priority.

# Rule 6: Proposing 
A proposal is a document that is publicly accessible, clearly intended to be part of the game of Infinite Nomic, and is clearly labeled as a proposal. The previous notwithstanding, a document that is clearly intended to be a proposal under a Local Ruleset is not a proposal under this ruleset.

When a proposal is passed, the changes to the game-state specified within that proposal take effect. For clarity, a proposal that simply declares something without specifying how the gamestate is altered has no effect. As an example, a proposal that states "Voting is illegal." or "Proposals cannot kill people" has no effect, as they do not specify any changes to the gamestate.

When more than two-thids of players vote in favor of a proposal, that proposal is passed.

For the purposes of Rule 5, proposals are a method to make changes to the Global Ruleset.

# Rule 7: Gaining points 
Each time a global rule-change is passed, an administrator shall roll one six-sided die for each nation and each nation gains the respective amount of points.

# Rule 8: Voting
Once a player has cast their vote on a proposal, they may not change it. Players may cast their vote by reacting to the proposal with either :white_check_mark: or :negative_squared_cross_mark:.

# Rule 9: Inactivity 
A player is considered inactive if they have not sent a message in any text channel within the last 7 days. Inactivate players are considered active again once they send a message into a text channel.

# Rule 10: Leaving the game 
A player may leave the game (stop being a player and stop being a member of any nation) by indicating their desire to do so. This rule is retroactive.

# Rule 11: Retroactivity 
No proposals, global or otherwise, including this one, may have retroactive effect.

# Rule 12: The Map
The official global map for this game shall be maintained at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TGE0Zp96VnnxCGHLmK-RmwbyPParptyytb60YsaxS5U/edit#gid=0 and shall be editable by all players in the game. If this proposal is passed, a die shall be rolled to assign each nation to one of the three territories on the map.

Each nation will have the power to regulate via its local rules its own cells on the map and how to edit them. Unless a nation's rules explictly grant permission, no player from a different nation may change any part of its territory.

The initial cells found on the map are of the following types: empty, water, mountain, and forest. The borders between cells may represent rivers or national borders (or both).

# Rule 13: Validating & invalidating proposals
1. Global proposals are marked with a no_entry_sign if a rule determines that they have failed or been invalidated
2. A global proposal being edited will automatically invalidate it
3. Failed or invalidated proposals cannot pass under any circumstances
4.  Global proposals may be invalidated by the player that proposed them at any time as long as the proposal has not already passed
5. A global proposal that is not invalidated and does not meet the normal criteria for passing can pass if it meets the following special criteria:
*72 hours have passed since the proposal was made
*At least one third of the games active players have voted on the proposal
*At least two thirds of the votes have been positive

# Rule 14: Retracting proposals
You may retract a proposal. Before the proposal has solidified, you can remove it. You may do so however you like, as long as you clarify that you retract it and that it is no longer up for voting.

# Rule 15: Impassible Terrain
Any cell on the global map of either the mountain or water type are impassible by default.

Nations can purchase climbing gear for traversing mountains, and boats for traversing water from the server for 3 points, or from each other for an agreed upon amount of points.

# Rule 16: Accurate Census Act
Each time the total number of players is adjusted, the user who makes the adjustment must proclaim the following in the global-forum:

1.    The total number of players before the change being made
2.    The most recent Global Proposal Number
3.    The new total number of players
4.    The total number of The Fire Nation Citizens
5.    The total number of The Yellow Nation Gulings
6.    The total number of The Blue Nation Members

# Rule 17: Leaving the Game 2 (The Redundancyinging)
A player may leave the game (stop being a player and stop being a member of any nation) by indicating their desire to do so.

# Rule 18: Best in Show
On a voting day, a delegate from each nation must publically cast a vote on which other nation has the best nation ruleset. The nation with the most votes recieves 2d6 points. In the event of a tie, no points are awarded.

Delegates may not vote for their own nation, nor abstain, nor withdraw or change a vote once cast. Nations may appoint their delegates however they choose, and may regulate their delegate’s criteria or vote however they choose without contradicting the global rules.

A voting day may be designated by any nation’s delegate by posting public notice of the voting day with a minimum of six day’s notice

# Rule 19:  Proposal Marking
Whenever a propasal in #global-proposals has achieved the required amount of votes to come into effect, a Moderator will mark it with :o: to show that the proposal is in effect. If the proposal fails to come into effect through too many negative votes or timing out, it is marked with :x: by a Moderator and any further votes have no affect.

# Rule 20: War

During war each nation may wager something agreed upfront on a game decided by both of the nations , the winner receives the full prize waged in the war.

# Rule 21: Proposal Timeout
If after 72 hours a proposal doesn't pass, it fails.

# Rule 22: Typo Correction
If a typo's intended meaning is undisputable, then it may be ignored. Modmins may fix any such typos in the rules on GitHub.

# Rule 23:  Equal woods and mountains distribution
The map shall be edited to make sure that each nation has the same number of forest and mountain tiles within its borders. The map shall also be edited to change "forest" tiles to "woods" tiles. The map shall also be edited to add a new type of tile called "prairie" tiles, and each nation shall have the same number of prairie tiles within its borders.

# Rule 24: Exclusive Victory
No more than one nation can win the game.

# Rule 25: Foreign Currency Production Ban
A nation may not produce currency that was created by a different nation.

# Rule 26: Materials

Materials, their buying and selling prices, each nation's stock of each; as well as buildings, their material costs, material production, production costs, and other requirements, shall be maintained at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lgtb7sDdLASznDBFg8AMh8ktA8Hqn8PahL-_3leWKO0/edit?usp=drivesdk

Materials labeled under Buyables can be purchased from the server for points, determined by Points Cost. All materials listed can be sold back to the server for points, determined by Points Sell. Materials can be traded or sold between nations for points or other materials.

Buildings take up 1 tile of empty land in the global map. Some buildings require specific terrain types to be adjacent, as determined by Requires. Buildings require materials to build, as determined by Building Cost.

When a nation decides to use a building, three things must be true:
1) the nation must have at least 1 stock of Meal.
2) the nation must have the required stock from that building's Consumption.
3) if the building is a Shipyard, the nation must have at least 1 boat to use this building, as specified by Requires.
Once those requirements are met, 1 Meal is removed from the nation's stock, the building adds Materials to the nation's stock, as determined by Production, and removes Materials from the nation's stock, as determined by Consumption.

Each nation is given an initial stock of 5 Logs, 10 Meals, and 3 Stone.
